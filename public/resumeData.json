    "bio": "Hi there im Jacob, I have been interested in coding since I saw the matrix in 1999, and I have tried learning over the years, but family responibility or work prevented me, but this past year, I had the chance to go to Bottega University, and I excelled at it,I put in the work to fully understand it as deep as I could within the time i had. Bottega changed my life and now I am looking for a opportunity to level up my skills and abilities.",

He’s the type of person that, if he doesn’t know the answer, he takes it upon himself to figure it out. Getting started in his software journey wasn’t easy. We hit not one, not 2, but three roadblocks. Each time he didn’t give up and meet the challenge head-on. His abundance of enthusiasm for learning and adapting is the first thing you notice about him. Jacob is going to be a rock star in the software industry because he brings with him a myriad of life experience and humility that come for someone that has taken the challenge for rebuilding themselves. He has surpassed expectations time and time again. I’m so excited that I was able to be apart of his journey and can’t wait to see what the future hold for him!",

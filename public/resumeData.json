        "text": "I met Jacob during a time in his life when he was going through a career transition. I’ve been so amazed by his focus and determination to reach his goals. He’s the type of person that, if he doesn’t know the answer, he takes it upon himself to figure it out. Getting started in his software journey wasn’t easy. We hit not one, not 2, but three roadblocks. Each time he didn’t give up and meet the challenge head-on. His abundance of enthusiasm for learning and adapting is the first thing you notice about him. Jacob is going to be a rock star in the software industry because he brings with him a myriad of life experience and humility that come for someone that has taken the challenge for rebuilding themselves. He has surpassed expectations time and time again. I’m so excited that I was able to be apart of his journey and can’t wait to see what the future hold for him!",
